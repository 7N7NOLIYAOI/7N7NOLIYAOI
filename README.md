  <summary>basic info / abt me</summary>
  <p>hihi my names eden , seven or simply just elliot !! considering this is a pt-centered github there isn't much to expect from me besides just being another person you stumble upon in a pixel pony game. you can refer to me however you'd like as i am unlabelled (questioning genderfluid) and i have little preference when it comes to attraction but am demisexual lol. i am also a minor, i will not disclose anything blatant but i am a teenager in highschool. 
   
  i am very evasive of my identity, or not certain times as i have a tendency to overshare or close off every bit of information from new people i meet out of paranoia or habit— it is nothing against you!!!
  i skip and dilly dally around the map rather often whether i be alone or with my bestest of oomfs seb and faris whenever i have spare time or am bored. you can almost always find me lurking around within or on the outerskirts of any roblox-based area such as around the spawn or cliffs, or around bakery and am almost always offtab or in party chat but don't feel scared to drop a whisper or leave something anon on my strawpage or atabook!!!
  
  i do not allow copying or referencing of any sorts of my skins as i spend rather a lot of time trying to tint ts and i'd be appreciative that you don't copy my ponies— light inspo is acceptable but i will borderline not allow referencing or copying of any sort unless ur an oomf i talk to REGULARLY or if the pony is a gift.
  
  i am very very skittish and anxious around new folks as kind of implied earlier on, especially with specific warnings in my pony names such as "iwc (interact with caution/comfort)" or "dniu (do not interact unless)" in my names. if i am alone i will 99% be very reluctant to speak / open up but i swear i am kind.
  
  i have repetitive speech patterns and vocal stims that i often pick up from doomscrolling or from oomfs so please keep that in mind if i come across as boring or annoying, please just tell me to shut up nicely if you are fed up with it. i have audhd (diagnosed) as far as im willing to share and do often need tonetags so people can get their point across.

  for the sake of my sanity i typically block freely and still follow basic dni criteria like any ordinary human beings. dont talk to me about ur odd paraphilias or grow unhealthy attachments to me pls. just pls have common sense on this pixelated pony game when interacting and dont be a dick.
  
  im the biggest nico di angelo kin and elliot fictkin you'll ever meet (i dont mind doubles / other elliot fictkins or whateverrr :3) </p>
